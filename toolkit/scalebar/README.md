# Scalebar
A scalebar displays the representation of an accurate linear measurement on the map. It provides a visual indication through which users can determine the size of features or the distance between features on a map. A scale bar is a line or bar divided into parts. It is labeled with its ground length, usually in multiples of map units, such as tens of kilometers or hundreds of miles.
