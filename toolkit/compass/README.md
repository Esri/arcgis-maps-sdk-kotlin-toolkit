# Compass
The Compass displays the current viewpoint rotation of a MapView by displaying a compass icon that points north.
The Compass supports resetting the rotation by tapping the icon, which resets the map to it's default 0 degree orientation.

By default the Compass is set to auto hide, hence it will only appear when the map is rotated and is hidden when the current map orientation is 0 degrees. This behavior is configurable.

Note that the MapView auto-snaps back to north when it's within a threshold of north, and in that case the compass also auto hides.
