# Popup Micro-app

This micro-app demonstrates the use of the `Popup` toolkit component which provides a rich, responsive view of information about a GeoElement.

## Usage

The application provides a map viewer, which invokes the form when GeoElements are tapped.

For more information on the `Popup` component and how it works, see its [Readme](../../toolkit/popup/README.md).
