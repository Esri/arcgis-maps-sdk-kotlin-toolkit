This micro-app demonstrates the use of the [FeatureForm](../../toolkit/featureforms/README.md) toolkit component which provides a rich, dynamic, and responsive form
for editing Feature attributes.

## Usage

The application provides a web map gallery and a map viewer which invokes the form when Features are tapped.
Authentication is optional but limited to specific public web maps.

To login to your ArcGIS Online account, click the `Sign in with ArcGIS Online` button in the app. This will open a new OAuth window where you can sign in with your ArcGIS Online account. 
Once you have signed in, you can access the web maps that are shared with your account.

To login to your ArcGIS Enterprise account, click the `Sign in with ArcGIS Enterprise` button in the app. This will open a new window where you can enter the enterprise URL and sign in with your username and password.

For more information on the `FeatureForm` component and how it works, see it's [Readme](../../toolkit/featureforms/README.md).
