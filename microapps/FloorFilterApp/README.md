# FloorFilterApp

This micro app showcases the use of the FloorFilter toolkit component. It uses the map of a fictional corporate campus "made up" data following 
the Indoors Information Model schema and floor awareness.

When the Site button is tapped, a prompt opens so the user can select a site and then a facility. After selecting a site and facility,
a list of levels is displayed.-
