# SceneView Callout Micro-app

This micro-app showcases the use of `Callout` with a composable `SceneView`. Callout is a composable function that renders an empty composable Box at a specified point or GeoElement on a Scene. The content of the composable Box is customizable, and the container is a stylable rectangular shape with a leader line positioned at the tap location or GeoElement passed into the `Callout` composable function.

## Usage

The application displays a screen containing a `SceneView` that, when tapped, shows a Callout and a red graphic cross marking the tapped location.
For more information on the composable `Callout` component and how it works, see its section in the composable GeoView [Readme](../../toolkit/geoview-compose#display-a-callout).
