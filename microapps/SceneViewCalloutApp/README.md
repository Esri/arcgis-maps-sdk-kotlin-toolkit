# SceneView Callout Micro-app

This micro-app demonstrates the use of `Callout` with a composable `SceneView`. `Callout` is a composable function which renders an empty composable Box placed at some point or GeoElement on a Scene. The content of the composable Box is customizable, while the container of the Box is a stylable rectangular shape with a leader line positioned at the point of the tap or GeoElement passed into the `Callout` composable functions.

## Usage

The application displays a screen containing a `SceneView` that, when tapped, shows a Callout and a red graphic cross marking the tapped location.
For more information on the composable `Callout` component and how it works, see its section in the composable GeoView [Readme](../../toolkit/geoview-compose#display-a-callout).
