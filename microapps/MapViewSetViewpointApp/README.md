This micro-app demonstrates the use of `MapViewpointOperation` with a composable `MapView`.

## Usage

The application starts with a MapView and displays a map. Use the overflow action button in the app bar to choose between different `MapViewpointOperations` to be performed on the composable MapView. Each operation will set the viewpoint to center on Sofia, Bulgaria.

For more information on the composable `MapView` component and how it works, see it's [Readme](../../toolkit/geo-compose/README.md).
