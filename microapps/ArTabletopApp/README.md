# AR TableTop Micro-app

This micro-app demonstrates the use of the `TableTopSceneView` toolkit component which renders an `ArcGISSceneLayer` with buildings onto a physical surface detected in the device's camera feed.

## Usage

Launch the app and follow on-screen instructions to point the camera towards a surface while moving the device slightly. When a surface is detected it will appear as a grid of white lines in the camera feed. Tap on the grid to choose an anchor location to place the 3D buildings. Shortly after tapping on the screen, the buildings will appear as shown in the screenshot above. 

For more information on the `TableTopSceneView` component and how it works, see it's [Readme](../../toolkit/ar/README.md).
