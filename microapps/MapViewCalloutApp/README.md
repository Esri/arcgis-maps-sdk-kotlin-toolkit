# MapView Callout Micro-app

This micro-app demonstrates the use of `Callout` with a composable `MapView`.

## Usage

The application starts with a `MapView`. A `Callout` is shown on the `MapView` when you tap on it.

For more information on the composable `MapView` component and how it works, see it's [Readme](../../toolkit/geoview-compose/README.md).
