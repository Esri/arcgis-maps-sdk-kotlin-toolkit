# MapView Callout Micro-app

This micro-app demonstrates the use of `Callout` with a composable `MapView`. `Callout` is a composable function which renders an empty composable Box placed at some point or GeoElement on a Map. The content of the composable Box is customizable, while the container of the Box is a stylable rectangular shape with a leader line positioned at the point of the tap or GeoElement passed into the `Callout` composable functions.

## Usage

The application starts with a choice of two screens
* A `MapView` with `Callout`s placed at the location of user taps on the screen.
* A `MapView` with `Callout`s placed on GeoElements tapped by the user.
* For more information on the composable `MapView` component and how it works, see it's [Readme](../../toolkit/geoview-compose/README.md).
